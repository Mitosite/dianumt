# Data used in the dianumt pipeline for analysis of mitochondrial reads, as implented on the HAMSTR webpage


## Simulated datasets

We use the [wgsim](https://github.com/lh3/wgsim) utility to simulate reads with desired parameters.

### nuclear_data

Data simulated with the followig wgsim commands:

Single end reads, length 100bp and 100,000 reads created each time.
No indels, no mutations.
Error rate varying: 0.0 0.1 0.5 1.0 2.0 5.0 1.0

## Reference mitochondria files

chrMT and shifted_chrMT are taken from the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence of the human mitochondrial DNA ([rCRS](https://www.mitomap.org/MITOMAP/HumanMitoSeq)) - NCBI [entry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/251831106). The breakpoint in the shifted version was artificially offset by **8285** bases to take into account the circularity of mitochondria.

## Numts files

Reference numts files as coordinates, stored in the [bed](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) format. If available, two versions are used: one with the coordinates of numts on the nucleus (\*.nuclear.bed), and one with the corresponding location of the numts on the mitochondria (\*.mitochondrial.bed).
